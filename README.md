# Multiple-File-Protein-prediction-in-AlphaFold2-ColabFold

### The provided code snippet forms a critical component of an automated script aimed at facilitating the prediction of protein structures using the AlphaFold model within a Google Colab environment. The script is tailored to handle the simultaneous upload of multiple input files, each containing multiple protein sequences for prediction. The code initiates by configuring preferences, such as determining whether images should be displayed during execution, and importing essential modules. It performs checks to identify specific GPU types and adapts environment variables accordingly.

### An array of callback functions is defined, enabling the visualization of multiple sequence alignments and the predicted protein structures. As the script progresses, it processes the uploaded protein sequences from multiple files, generating unique job names and establishing directories to store the forthcoming results. In a systematic loop, the script iterates through these designated job names. For each job, it configures prediction parameters and invokes the AlphaFold model to predict protein structures for the corresponding sequences.

### This integrated system is meticulously designed to offer a seamless user experience. It not only streamlines the prediction process but also ensures the entire pipeline is automated â€“ from the initial upload of files containing protein sequences to the final step of packaging and saving the prediction results. This comprehensive automation, coupled with interactive widgets and the utilization of the ColabFold package, underscores the script's capability to empower users with efficient and hands-free protein structure prediction and result management.
