# Multiple-File-Protein-prediction-in-AlphaFold2-ColabFold

### The provided code snippet forms a critical component of an automated script aimed at facilitating the prediction of protein structures using the AlphaFold model within a Google Colab environment. The script is tailored to handle the simultaneous upload of multiple input files, each containing multiple protein sequences for prediction. The code initiates by configuring preferences, such as determining whether images should be displayed during execution, and importing essential modules. It performs checks to identify specific GPU types and adapts environment variables accordingly.

### An array of callback functions is defined, enabling the visualization of multiple sequence alignments and the predicted protein structures. As the script progresses, it processes the uploaded protein sequences from multiple files, generating unique job names and establishing directories to store the forthcoming results. In a systematic loop, the script iterates through these designated job names. For each job, it configures prediction parameters and invokes the AlphaFold model to predict protein structures for the corresponding sequences.

### This integrated system is meticulously designed to offer a seamless user experience. It not only streamlines the prediction process but also ensures the entire pipeline is automated â€“ from the initial upload of files containing protein sequences to the final step of packaging and saving the prediction results. This comprehensive automation, coupled with interactive widgets and the utilization of the ColabFold package, underscores the script's capability to empower users with efficient and hands-free protein structure prediction and result management.

This code appears to be a part of a larger script or program. It seems to be related to using Google Colab and the ColabFold package, which provides a convenient way to run AlphaFold, a protein structure prediction model. Let's break down the code step by step:

    Display Images Setting:

    python

display_images = True #@param {type:"boolean"}

This line creates a boolean variable display_images that can be toggled using Colab's interactive widgets. It will be used to determine whether to display images during the execution of the code.

Importing Modules:

python

import sys
import warnings
warnings.simplefilter(action='ignore', category=FutureWarning)
from Bio import BiopythonDeprecationWarning
warnings.simplefilter(action='ignore', category=BiopythonDeprecationWarning)
from pathlib import Path
from colabfold.download import download_alphafold_params, default_data_dir
from colabfold.utils import setup_logging
from colabfold.batch import get_queries, run, set_model_type
from colabfold.plot import plot_msa_v2

import os
import numpy as np

This section imports various Python modules and classes required for the rest of the code. It includes modules for handling warnings, working with file paths, downloading AlphaFold parameters, setting up logging, managing batches of protein sequences, and plotting Multiple Sequence Alignments (MSAs).

Checking for GPU Type and Adjusting Environment:

python

try:
    K80_chk = os.popen('nvidia-smi | grep "Tesla K80" | wc -l').read()
except:
    K80_chk = "0"
    pass
if "1" in K80_chk:
    # ... (code to modify environment variables)

This section checks if a specific GPU type (Tesla K80) is available. If it's found, it prints a warning and adjusts certain environment variables related to memory management.

Additional Imports and Configuration:

python

from colabfold.colabfold import plot_protein
from pathlib import Path
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

Here, additional functions and classes are imported for protein visualization, working with file paths, and plotting using Matplotlib.

Setting Up PDBFixer Import Path (if condition):

python

if use_amber and f"/usr/local/lib/python{python_version}/site-packages/" not in sys.path:
    sys.path.insert(0, f"/usr/local/lib/python{python_version}/site-packages/")

This part of the code seems to be specific to handling the Amber molecular dynamics package (use_amber) and adjusting the Python path to include the necessary packages.

Input Features Callback Function:

python

def input_features_callback(input_features):  
    if display_images:    
        plot_msa_v2(input_features)
        plt.show()
        plt.close()

This function input_features_callback is responsible for displaying an MSA plot if display_images is set to True.

Prediction Callback Function:

python

def prediction_callback(protein_obj, length,
                        prediction_result, input_features, mode):
    model_name, relaxed = mode
    if not relaxed:
        if display_images:
            fig = plot_protein(protein_obj, Ls=length, dpi=150)
            plt.show()
            plt.close()

This function prediction_callback handles the visualization of predicted protein structures. It uses the plot_protein function to create a plot if display_images is True and the prediction is not relaxed.

Processing Uploaded Files:

python

uploaded_files = files.upload()

for input_filename, uploaded_content in uploaded_files.items():
    # ... (code to process uploaded content and create jobname)

This section deals with processing uploaded protein sequences. It reads the uploaded files, processes the sequences, generates a unique job name based on the input file, and prepares a directory to save the results.

Running Protein Structure Predictions:

python

    for jobname in jobname_list:
        # ... (code to set up prediction parameters and run predictions)

    This part iterates through the list of job names and runs protein structure predictions using the AlphaFold model. It sets up various parameters for the prediction process.

    Packaging and Downloading Results:

python

for jobname in jobname_list:
    # ... (code to package results, download results, and optionally upload to Google Drive)

Finally, this section iterates through the job names, packages the prediction results into a ZIP file, and provides options for downloading the ZIP file or uploading it to Google Drive.

Please note that the code assumes the availability of certain modules, functions, and variables that are defined elsewhere. To fully understand how this code fits into the larger context and its intended use, you would need to examine the entire program or script it's a part of.
